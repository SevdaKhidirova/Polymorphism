# Polymorphism
The main ideas behind Java’s Object-Oriented Programming, OOP concepts include abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. 
Basically, Java OOP concepts let us create working methods and variables, then re-use all or part of them without compromising security. 
Grasping OOP concepts is key to understanding how Java works.

what is the abstraction ?
Abstraction is one of the key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. Its main goal is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary 
details from the user. That enables the user to implement more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking 
about all the hidden complexity.That’s a very generic concept that’s not limited to object-oriented programming. You can find it everywhere in the real world.
